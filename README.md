## Guidelines
This README will describe how to interact with the Iron Alum API. 
It provides guidelines and examples for the Iron Alum API in hopes to  encourage consistency and maintainability across multiple devices and applications.  

This document borrows heavily from:

* [White House Web API Standards] (http://github.com/WhiteHouse/api-standards/blob/master/README.md)
* [Ryan Yep's Find-A-Spot README] (http://github.com/rcyep87/Find-A-Spot/blob/master/README.md)

## RESTful URLs

### General guidelines for RESTful URLs
* A URL identifies a resource.
* URLs should include nouns, not verbs.

* Use HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to operate on the collections and elements.
* You shouldnâ€™t need to go deeper than resource/identifier/resource.
